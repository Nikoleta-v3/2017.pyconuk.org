Using a hands-on based approach with Jupyter notebooks, attendees will go from beginner level to have a better appreciation of neural networks and Convolution neural networks in 3 hours.

Section 1 In this first section, attendees will be introducted to neural networks concluding with coding a neural network

Section 2 Now that the participants have had a better understanding of neural networks, we will look at Convolution neural networks and what makes them good at image recognition tasks.

Section 3 In this final section, we will look briefly at VGG16 and the history of the Imagenet challenge.

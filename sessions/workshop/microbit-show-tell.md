This will be an informal open session for people to come and try micro:bit, or demo the things they’ve done. If you’ve been given a micro:bit during the conference, then why not come and demo what you’ve done with it.

If you’d like to come and try a micro:bit, please bring a laptop with you, and we’ll have the rest.

All projects welcome

If you’re brining things, please come from 1400 to setup.

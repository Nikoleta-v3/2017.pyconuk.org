In this talk we will present the plans for how accessory makers and library designers can publish and share code for the micro:bit so that we don’t need to copy/paste drivers for different accessories into our program

We’ve got some new user interfaces to demo, and will walk through examples of how you can publish a module for the micro:bit that will happily coexist with the rest of a user’s program

We’d like to hear from people with experience shipping polished open-source products to end users (not developers), while still leaving space and enjoyment for a community to contribute and innovate. Help!

The title of this discussion refers to the fact that often once the first "90% of development" is done, it becomes clear there’s another 90% to do before the feature that’s been developed, invented and implemented is ready for deployment to a large audience in a stable and maintainable way. How can we make sure great stuff reaches uses at a high quality, while still keeping a sense of fun for contributors.

This will be a contributed talk from a few members of the microbit teaching community, explaining what it’s like in real schools - for example why is a web-based editor important for some schools - and why is it totally wrong for others?

We’ll leave time at the end for some open discussion about how we can improve the way micro:bit works in schools for teachers

- This talk will focus on the complexities of large, real world engineering projects, with an emphasis on how to learn from the project and reproduce the things micro:bit did well,
- …while avoiding some of the issues that held the project back.
- In telling the story of how the micro:bit finally made it to production, we will cover:
 - What is the BBC micro:bit, what can it do? How can something so small run Python? Javascript?
 - Why was it late to market?
 - What’s left to do!

The emphasis will be on drawing some generally applicable engineering lessons from the project, so is suitable for people whether or not you’ve used a micro:bit before!
